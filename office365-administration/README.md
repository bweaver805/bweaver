Office 365 Administration Toolkit
Enterprise‑grade workflows, documentation, and scripts for managing Office 365 environments with a focus on security, identity, and operational consistency.
Overview
This repository captures the patterns, standards, and workflows I use to administer and secure Office 365 environments at scale. It includes documentation, lifecycle processes, and automation examples for Exchange Online, Azure AD, Teams, SharePoint, and Intune MDM/MAM.
